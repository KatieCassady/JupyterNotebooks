    "# The [while](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#while) loop\n",
    "\n",
    "You already know the `for` loop. There is a second loop, the `while` loop. The `while` loop offers more options, but is\n",
    "also a bit more complex in its usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `for` loop fits whenever you have a sequence, such as a list or a given number of elements like a `range`. However,\n",
    "there are also situations where no sequence is available and yet a certain operation needs to be repeated multiple times:\n",
    "- At the ATM a PIN has to be entered (again and again) until it is entered correctly\n",
    "- A number should be entered until it is actually a number and the input string can be converted to an integer\n",
    "- A user should answer questions until no new question comes up. In this case a `for` loop works only with \"trickery\",\n",
    "  it is better to use a `while` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Syntax of the `while` loop\n",
    "\n",
    "A `while` loop is (in the simplest case) constructed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "while condition:\n",
    "    statement1\n",
    "    statement2\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    statementN\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The loop begins with the keyword `while`, followed by a condition (like in an `if` branch) followed by a colon. The\n",
    "following block is indented as in all other control structures. When no more lines are indented, the `while` loop is\n",
    "finished and the program continues after the loop in the non-indented part.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Semantics of the `while` loop\n",
    "\n",
    "When the program reaches the loop, the condition behind the `while` keyword is checked. If this condition is `True`, the\n",
    "loop body is executed. At the end of the loop body, the program jumps back to the `while` and checks the condition\n",
    "again.  \n",
    "The loop is executed until the condition is `False`. After that, the program will continue after the\n",
    "loop.  \n",
    "What happens if the condition is `False` when the `while` loop is reached the first time? Then the loop body is simply\n",
    "skipped and the program continues directly after the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: `input()` until a number is entered\n",
    "\n",
    "You know the problem: A number is to be entered via an `input()`. In order to execute calculations with the number, it\n",
    "must first be converted from a string to an number (e.g. an integer with the function `int()`). And if the user does\n",
    "not enter a number, the program crashes during the conversion."
